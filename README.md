# database_for_crime_reports
The goal of this guided project is for you to create a database named crimes_db with a table – boston_crimes – with appropriate datatypes for storing the data from the boston.csv file. You will be creating the table inside a schema named crimes. You will also create the readonly and readwrite groups with the appropriate privileges as we have discussed in this course. Finally, you will also need to create one user for each of these groups.

The following diagram illustrates a high level overview of what we want to achieve:
